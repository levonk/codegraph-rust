# CodeGraph MCP Server Changelog

All notable changes to the CodeGraph MCP Intelligence Platform will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added optional Nix flake support for building, running, installing, and developing CodeGraph with Nix (`nix run github:levonk/codegraph-rust`, `nix profile add github:levonk/codegraph-rust`). Includes `.#codegraph` (default features), `.#codegraph-full` (all features), `devShells.default`, and `overlays.default`. Also adds a Devbox environment and a path-filtered Nix CI workflow.

### 🚀 **Enhanced - Rig-Based Agent System (Now Default)**

#### **Default Backend Switch**
- **Rig is now the default agent backend**: The system now uses the high-performance Rig backend by default over the legacy AutoAgents implementation.
- **Improved Performance**: Rig delivers faster reasoning and better tool orchestration, especially with modern thinking models.

#### **Multi-Architecture Support**
- **LATS (Language Agent Tree Search)**: New `LatsAgent` implementation using Rig primitives for tree-based exploration.
- **Reflexion**: New `ReflexionAgent` that wraps other agents and automatically retries with self-reflection upon failure.
- **Dynamic Architecture Switching**: `RigExecutor` now intelligently selects the best architecture based on task complexity (e.g., LATS for Architecture Analysis) and can fallback on failure.
- **Streaming Support**: Added `execute_stream` to `RigAgentTrait` and `RigExecutor`, enabling real-time feedback (Thought/ToolCall/Result/Answer events).

#### **Dynamic Context Throttling**
- **Smart Tier Adjustment**: Agent now monitors context usage during execution.
- **Automatic Downgrade**: If context usage >80%, automatically downgrades tier (e.g., Detailed -> Terse prompts) to prevent overflow errors.
- **Prevention**: Proactively manages token budget to ensure successful completion of long analysis chains.

#### **Operational Enhancements**
- **Structured Output**: Added `response_format` support to `RigAgentBuilder` for schema-enforced answers.
- **Unified Interface**: Refactored `RigAgentTrait` to support both blocking and streaming execution modes across all architectures (ReAct, LATS, Reflexion).

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

#### **Agentic Tool Consolidation (8 → 4 Tools)**
- **Consolidated 8 agentic MCP tools into 4** to reduce cognitive load for AI agents:
  - `agentic_context` (absorbs: `agentic_code_search`, `agentic_context_builder`, `agentic_semantic_question`)
  - `agentic_impact` (absorbs: `agentic_dependency_analysis`, `agentic_call_chain_analysis`)
  - `agentic_architecture` (absorbs: `agentic_architecture_analysis`, `agentic_api_surface_analysis`)
  - `agentic_quality` (absorbs: `agentic_complexity_analysis`)

- **Optional `focus` parameter** for precision when needed:
  | Tool | Focus Values | Default Behavior |
  |------|-------------|-----------------|
  | `agentic_context` | `"search"`, `"builder"`, `"question"` | Auto-selects based on query |
  | `agentic_impact` | `"dependencies"`, `"call_chain"` | Both dependency chains and call flows |
  | `agentic_architecture` | `"structure"`, `"api_surface"` | Both structural and interface analysis |
  | `agentic_quality` | `"complexity"`, `"coupling"`, `"hotspots"` | Comprehensive risk assessment |

- **Migration guide**:
  - `agentic_code_search` → `agentic_context` (or with `focus: "search"`)
  - `agentic_dependency_analysis` → `agentic_impact` (or with `focus: "dependencies"`)
  - `agentic_call_chain_analysis` → `agentic_impact` with `focus: "call_chain"`
  - `agentic_architecture_analysis` → `agentic_architecture` (or with `focus: "structure"`)
  - `agentic_api_surface_analysis` → `agentic_architecture` with `focus: "api_surface"`
  - `agentic_context_builder` → `agentic_context` with `focus: "builder"`
  - `agentic_semantic_question` → `agentic_context` with `focus: "question"`
  - `agentic_complexity_analysis` → `agentic_quality`

- **Note**: Legacy tools were removed (not feature-gated) due to rmcp SDK limitation that prevents multiple `#[tool_router]` impl blocks.

### Added

#### **New SurrealQL Functions**
- `fn::get_top_directories($project_id, $limit)` - Returns top-level directories with node counts for project structure overview
- `fn::count_nodes_for_project($project_id)` - Returns node, edge, and chunk counts for health/diagnostics

#### **Experimental GraphDB Schema (Interoperable)**
- `schema/codegraph_graph_experimental.surql` can now be used interoperably with CodeGraph’s indexing pipeline and agentic tools (function surface aligned with `schema/codegraph.surql`).
- Enable by setting:
  - `CODEGRAPH_USE_GRAPH_SCHEMA=true`
  - `CODEGRAPH_GRAPH_DB_DATABASE=codegraph_experimental` (or your chosen DB name)
- Designed for faster/more efficient graph-style queries than the relational/vanilla schema on large codebases.

### Performance

#### **Sub-Second Graph Query Performance**
- **`fn::semantic_search_nodes_via_chunks`**: Optimized from 30-60 seconds to sub-second
  - Now uses HNSW KNN index via `<|K,EF|>` operator for O(log n) vector search
  - Batched edge context queries: 2 queries instead of 300+ nested subqueries
  - Edge enrichment moved after scoring/limiting to minimize expensive lookups

- **`fn::detect_circular_dependencies`**: Optimized from O(E²) to O(E)
  - Replaced correlated subquery per edge pair with edge key set membership check
  - Single pass with `INSIDE` operator instead of nested `SELECT count()` per pair

- **`fn::edge_context`**: Eliminated 30+ nested subqueries per call
  - Now uses direct field access (`to.name`, `to.node_type`) instead of nested SELECTs

- **`fn::get_hub_nodes`**: Early threshold filtering optimization
  - Filters by degree threshold BEFORE expensive `fn::node_info` calls
  - Reduces enrichment from 100s of candidates to max 50 filtered results

- **`fn::calculate_coupling_metrics`**: Fixed broken function
  - Was referencing undefined `$dependents`/`$dependencies` variables
  - Now correctly queries edges for incoming (afferent) and outgoing (efferent) coupling

#### **Rig Agent Tool Call Limits**
- Added explicit tool call limits to Rig agent prompts to prevent runaway execution
  - Small tier: 3 tool calls max
  - Medium tier: 5 tool calls max
  - Large tier: 6 tool calls max
  - Massive tier: 8 tool calls max
- Addresses issue where agents could make 10+ tool calls in a single query

#### **LSP Analysis & Graph Enrichment**
- **Fixed `lsp_uses` Metric**: Resolved issue where `lsp_uses` always returned 0 during indexing.
- **Enhanced Rust Extraction**: Added support for extracting type references from function signatures and struct fields, including full source spans for LSP resolution.
- **Improved Python Extraction**: Added extraction of type hints and base classes as reference edges with spans.
- **Enrichment Logic Update**: Refined the enrichment analyzer to count all LSP-resolved edges while promoting generic references to concrete uses.

#### **Database Storage Optimization**
- **Transparent Zstd Compression**: Implemented high-performance compression for code content and metadata fields in SurrealDB.
- **Significant Footprint Reduction**: Achieves 3-5x storage efficiency for source code snippets and large metadata JSON blobs.
- **Zero-Config Activation**: Proactively compresses any field larger than 1KB using optimized Zstd level 3.
- **Automatic Decompression**: Retrieval paths automatically detect and decompress data, ensuring full compatibility with existing tools and agents.

#### **LSP Analysis Performance**
- **Parallel File Processing**: Refactored LSP analyzer to process files concurrently (16x parallelism), eliminating the previous serial bottleneck.
- **Async Client**: Replaced blocking I/O with a fully async `LspClient` using Tokio channels and background tasks for non-blocking request/response handling.
- **Pipeline Saturation**: Allows the LSP server (e.g., `rust-analyzer`) to be fully utilized, significantly reducing total indexing time for large codebases.

#### **Cache System Reliability and Performance**
- **Read-Ahead Optimizer Fixes**: Resolved critical type mismatch and moved value issues in the read-ahead optimization engine.
- **Memory Profiler Integration**: Provided a minimal memory profiling implementation to support real-time allocation tracking and dashboard visualization.
- **Demo & Example Repairs**: Fully restored and fixed the `memory_profiler_demo` and `readahead_demo` examples, including proper formatting and dependency management.
- **Dependency Optimization**: Added `once_cell`, `uuid`, and enhanced `tracing-subscriber` configuration to the cache crate for improved robustness.

  - **Full graph context**: Includes all outgoing and incoming edges with relationship types
  - Edge types: `calls`, `imports`, `uses`, `extends`, `implements`, `references`
  - Uses `$parent.node_id` for correct record reference comparison in edge subqueries

#### **Incremental Indexing Improvements**
- **Better `--force` flag behavior**: Now performs clean delete-then-insert instead of upsert
  - Deletes all existing nodes, chunks, and edges for the project first
  - Then inserts fresh data ensuring no stale duplicates remain

- **Automatic re-indexing**: Changed files are automatically re-indexed using upsert semantics (no duplicates)
- **Circuit breaker pattern**: SurrealDB health monitoring with exponential backoff for resilience
- **PID file management**: Proper daemon lifecycle with process tracking and graceful shutdown
- **CLI commands**:
  - `codegraph daemon start <path>` - Start watching a project (with `--foreground` option for debugging)
  - `codegraph daemon stop <path>` - Stop the daemon for a project
  - `codegraph daemon status <path>` - Check daemon status (with `--json` option)
- **Language and pattern filtering**: Supports `--languages`, `--exclude`, and `--include` flags

- **Configuration support**: `[daemon].auto_start_with_mcp` in config.toml to enable by default
- **DaemonConfig**: New configuration struct in `codegraph-core` for daemon settings
- **DaemonManager**: Coordinates daemon lifecycle with MCP server lifecycle
- **Graceful cleanup**: Daemon stops automatically when MCP server exits

### Removed
- Dropped the transactional/versioning/branch N-API bindings plus their documentation; the native TypeScript surface now focuses on semantic search, graph analysis, and cloud configuration so it matches the Surreal-only architecture.
- Replaced the native addon example with a semantic-search walkthrough and removed CLI-centric integration snippets that referenced the deleted CodeGraph CLI.
- Removed the unpublished `sdk/codegraph-cli-wrapper.ts` helper that shell-executed the old CLI, keeping the SDK focused on the MCP WebSocket client (run `npm install` before `npm run typecheck` if you want to lint the SDK locally).

## [1.1.0] - 2025-11-18 - AutoAgents Integration & SurrealDB 2.x Compatibility

### 🚀 **Added - AutoAgents Framework Integration (Experimental)**

- **Schema**: HNSW index for `embedding_768` column with EFC 200, M 16
- **Auto-detection**: Automatic column selection based on embedding dimension

#### **Structured Output Enforcement with JSON Schemas**
- **JSON schema enforcement** for all 7 agentic tools with **required file paths**
- **Schema-driven outputs**: LLM cannot return response without file locations
- **AutoAgents integration**: Uses `StructuredOutputFormat` passed via `AgentDeriveT::output_schema()`
- **New module**: `codegraph-ai/src/agentic_schemas.rs` with comprehensive schemas:
  - `CodeSearchOutput`: analysis + components[] + patterns[]
  - `DependencyAnalysisOutput`: analysis + components[] + dependencies[] + circular_dependencies[]
  - `CallChainOutput`: analysis + entry_point + call_chain[] + decision_points[]
  - `ArchitectureAnalysisOutput`: analysis + layers[] + hub_nodes[] + coupling_metrics[]
  - `APISurfaceOutput`: analysis + endpoints[] + usage_patterns[]
  - `ContextBuilderOutput`: comprehensive context with all analysis dimensions
  - `SemanticQuestionOutput`: answer + evidence[] + related_components[]
- **Required fields**: Core component arrays must include `name`, `file_path`, and `line_number`
- **Flexible fields**: Complex nested types (coupling_metrics, dependencies, etc.) accept either structured objects or simplified strings
- **Provider integration**:
  - Added `response_format` field to `GenerationConfig`
  - OpenAI compatible providers send JSON schema to LLM API
  - Ollama-native `format` field for compatibility (dual-field approach)
  - AutoAgents adapter converts `StructuredOutputFormat` to CodeGraph `ResponseFormat`
  - xAI/Grok supports Responses API with full `response_format.json_schema` support
- **Prompt updates**: All 28 tier prompts (4 tiers × 7 tools) updated to use structured format
- **Hybrid output**: Combines freeform `analysis` field with structured arrays
- **MCP handler**: Parses structured JSON and surfaces in `structured_output` field
- **Benefits**:
  - File paths are **mandatory** in core component arrays
  - Downstream tools can navigate directly to relevant code
  - Consistent data structure for programmatic consumption
  - Better agent-to-agent collaboration with actionable locations
  - Flexible parsing handles LLM variations while preserving essential data

#### **File Location Requirements in Agent Outputs (Deprecated)**
- **Superseded by**: Structured output enforcement with JSON schemas (above)
- **Legacy prompt updates**: All EXPLORATORY prompts requested file locations (now enforced)
- **Format**: `ComponentName in path/to/file.rs:line_number`
- **Example**: "ConfigLoader in src/config/loader.rs:42" instead of just "ConfigLoader"
- **6 prompts updated**: code_search, dependency_analysis, call_chain, architecture, context_builder, semantic_question, api_surface
- **Migration**: Prompts now work in conjunction with schema enforcement

### 🐛 **Fixed - AutoAgents and Structured Output Issues**

#### **Tier-Aware Token Limits**
- **Fixed**: AutoAgents ignored tier-based max_tokens (always used default ~4K)
- **Now**: Respects tier limits (Small: 2K, Medium: 4K, Large: 8K, Massive: 16K)
- **Override**: Set `MCP_CODE_AGENT_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` environment variable
- **Impact**: Massive tier (xAI Grok 2M) now outputs detailed 16K responses

#### **Prompt Format Clarification**
- **Fixed**: Architecture and semantic_question tools outputting both old wrapper format AND new structured format
- **Cause**: Prompts showed intermediate format alongside final format
- **Fix**: Clarified final response should be ONLY structured JSON (no reasoning/tool_call/is_final wrapper)

#### **HTTP Transport Testing**
- **Replaced**: Custom SSE parser (1,293 lines) with official MCP SDK `streamablehttp_client`
- **Added**: `test_http_mcp.py` using proper MCP protocol
- **Fixed**: Session management via `Mcp-Session-Id` header
- **Timeouts**: Extended to 300s for complex analysis

### 🐛 **Fixed - Critical Database Persistence Bugs**

#### **Async Writer Flush Bugs**
- **file_metadata flush**: Added missing flush after `persist_file_metadata()` (line 1237)
  - **Impact**: project_metadata and file_metadata tables remained empty
  - **Root cause**: Metadata queued but never written before shutdown
- **symbol_embeddings flush**: Added flush after symbol embedding precomputation (line 979)
  - **Impact**: symbol_embeddings table incomplete or empty
  - **Root cause**: Embeddings queued but not flushed before edge resolution
- **embedding_model tracking**: Added to node metadata in `annotate_node()`
  - **Impact**: Nodes showed hardcoded 'jina-embeddings-v4' instead of actual model
  - **Root cause**: embedding_model not added to metadata attributes

#### **AutoAgents Runtime Fixes**
- **Tool call parsing**: Implemented `tool_calls()` method to extract ToolCall from CodeGraph JSON
  - **Impact**: Agent was stopping at step 0, tools never executed
  - **Root cause**: `CodeGraphChatResponse::tool_calls()` always returned None
- **Runtime panic**: Fixed "Cannot start a runtime from within a runtime"
  - **Impact**: Tool execution crashed with panic
  - **Root cause**: Using `block_on` directly in async context
  - **Fix**: Wrapped in `tokio::task::block_in_place` at tool_executor_adapter.rs:38
- **Steps reporting**: Fixed `steps_taken` to show actual tool execution count
  - **Impact**: Always showed "0" even when tools executed
  - **Fix**: Extract count from `ReActAgentOutput.tool_calls.len()`
- **Feature-gate warning**: Fixed unused `ai_matches` variable warning
  - **Fix**: Added `#[cfg(feature = "ai-enhanced")]` to declaration and accumulation

### 🐛 **Fixed - SurrealDB 2.x Compatibility**

#### **Record ID System Overhaul**
- **Removed manual id field definitions** from 3 tables (nodes, edges, symbol_embeddings)
  - **Impact**: Defining `id` as string broke SurrealDB's built-in record ID system
  - **Root cause**: SurrealDB 2.x `id` is always a record type, overriding with string breaks queries
- **Updated fn::node_info()**: Changed parameter type from `string` to `record`
- **Added explicit record casting** to all 5 graph functions:
  - `fn::node_reference()`, `fn::get_transitive_dependencies()`, `fn::trace_call_chain()`
  - `fn::calculate_coupling_metrics()`, `fn::get_reverse_dependencies()`
  - **Pattern**: `LET $record = type::thing('nodes', $node_id);`
  - **Ref**: https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealql/datamodel/casting
- **Changed UPSERT queries** from `CONTENT` to `SET`:
  - **Impact**: CONTENT $doc tried to overwrite id field with string → data corruption
  - **Fix**: Explicit SET field list excludes id field
  - **Applies to**: UPSERT_NODES_QUERY, UPSERT_EDGES_QUERY, UPSERT_SYMBOL_EMBEDDINGS_QUERY

#### **Schema Syntax Corrections**
- **ASSERT statements**: Added `$value = NONE OR` for proper null handling
- **FLEXIBLE metadata**: Changed metadata fields to `FLEXIBLE TYPE option<object>`
- **HNSW syntax**: Corrected index definitions for SurrealDB 2.3.10
- **Removed duplicate**: Eliminated duplicate ANALYZER definition

### ⚡ **Performance Improvements**

#### **File Metadata Optimization (120x Faster)**
- **Optimized complexity**: O(N²) → O(N) using HashMaps
- **Before**: 2 minutes for 1,000 files (10M+ iterations)
- **After**: ~1 second for 1,000 files (15K iterations)
- **Pattern**: Pre-build lookup tables instead of nested iterations
- **Added progress bar**: Shows file-by-file processing status

#### **Throughput Display Fixes**
- **Fixed duplicate units**: "21,970/s/s" → "21,970/s"
- **Root cause**: `{per_sec}` placeholder already includes "/s" suffix
- **Fixed 3 progress bars**: batch, enhanced, simple progress templates

### 🗑️ **Removed**
- **Surreal-only runtime**: Deleted all FAISS/RocksDB features, installers, and vector backends. MCP server, CLI, and SDK now require SurrealDB for graph + vector persistence with no fallback.
- **Dependency cleanup**: Removed 79 unused dependencies across 17 crates
  - **Tool**: cargo machete for detection
  - **Impact**: Faster compilation, smaller binaries
- **Broken schema files**: Deleted 6 individual function files in `schema/functions/`
  - **calculate_coupling_metrics.surql**: Syntax error with orphaned code
  - **detect_circular_dependencies.surql**: Wrong function name (fn::coupling_metrics)
  - **get_hub_nodes.surql**: Wrong function signature
  - **get_reverse_dependencies.surql, get_transitive_dependencies.surql, trace_call_chain.surql**: Incomplete implementations
  - **Impact**: Conflicted with correct implementations in codegraph.surql

### ⚠️ **Breaking Changes**

#### **SurrealDB Schema Migration Required**
- **Record ID system change**: Manual `id` field definitions removed
- **Migration steps**:
  1. Re-apply schema: `cd schema && ./apply-schema.sh`
  2. Re-index codebase: `codegraph index -l rust -r --force .`
- **Reason**: Compatibility with SurrealDB 2.x record ID handling
- **Impact**: Existing data incompatible, full re-index required

#### **AutoAgents Feature Flag**
- **Default**: Uses legacy orchestrator (stable)
- **Experimental**: Use `autoagents-experimental` feature for new framework
- **Build**: `cargo build --features "autoagents-experimental,ai-enhanced,faiss,ollama"`
- **Status**: Testing in progress, production-ready in v1.2.0

### 📝 **Changed**

#### **Environment Variables**
- **Unified chunking**: `CODEGRAPH_MAX_CHUNK_TOKENS` now works across all providers
- **Ollama support**: Ollama provider now respects chunking configuration
- **Jina unchanged**: Still uses `JINA_MAX_TOKENS` (provider-specific)

### 📦 **Dependencies**

#### **Added**
- **schemars** (workspace): JSON schema generation for structured LLM outputs
  - Used in `codegraph-ai` for agentic schema definitions
  - Enables compile-time schema validation
  - Auto-generates JSON Schema from Rust types

### 📚 **Documentation**
- **GraphFunctions enrichment plan**: Comprehensive plan saved to `.ouroboros/plans/graphfunctions-enrichment-20251118.md`
  - Schema alignment recommendations
  - Missing field identification (qualified_name, column positions, timestamps)
  - Implementation phases with SQL examples

## [Unreleased] - 2025-01-08 - Agentic Code Intelligence & Architecture Migration

### 🚀 **Added - Agentic MCP Tools (AI-Enhanced Feature)**

#### **1. Tier-Aware Agentic Orchestration**
- **7 Agentic MCP Tools**: Multi-step reasoning workflows for comprehensive code analysis
  - `agentic_code_search` - Autonomous graph exploration for code search
  - `agentic_dependency_analysis` - Dependency chain and impact analysis
  - `agentic_call_chain_analysis` - Execution flow tracing
  - `agentic_architecture_analysis` - Architectural pattern assessment
  - `agentic_api_surface_analysis` - Public interface analysis
  - `agentic_context_builder` - Comprehensive context gathering
  - `agentic_semantic_question` - Complex codebase Q&A
- **Automatic tier detection**: Based on LLM context window (Small/Medium/Large/Massive)
- **Tier-aware prompting**: 28 specialized prompts (7 types × 4 tiers)
  - Small (<50K): TERSE prompts, 5 max steps, 2,048 tokens
  - Medium (50K-150K): BALANCED prompts, 10 max steps, 4,096 tokens
  - Large (150K-500K): DETAILED prompts, 15 max steps, 8,192 tokens
  - Massive (>500K): EXPLORATORY prompts, 20 max steps, 16,384 tokens
- **LRU caching**: Transparent SurrealDB result caching (100 entries default)
- **Configurable max tokens**: `MCP_CODE_AGENT_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` env variable

#### **2. Graph Analysis Integration**
- **6 SurrealDB graph tools**: Deep structural code analysis
  - `get_transitive_dependencies` - Full dependency chains
  - `detect_circular_dependencies` - Cycle detection
  - `trace_call_chain` - Execution path analysis
  - `calculate_coupling_metrics` - Ca, Ce, I metrics
  - `get_hub_nodes` - Architectural hotspot detection
  - `get_reverse_dependencies` - Change impact assessment
- **Zero-heuristic design**: LLM infers from structured data only
- **Tool call logging**: Complete reasoning traces with execution stats
- **Cache statistics**: Hit rate, evictions, size tracking

#### **3. CLI Enhancements**
- **New command**: `codegraph config agent-status`
  - Shows LLM provider, context tier, prompt verbosity
  - Lists all available MCP tools with descriptions
  - Displays orchestrator settings (max steps, cache, tokens)
  - JSON output support for automation
- **Configuration visibility**: Understand how config affects system behavior

### ✅ **Added - Local Surreal Embeddings & Reranking**
- SurrealDB indexing now honors local embedding providers (Ollama + LM Studio) using the same workflow as Jina—set `CODEGRAPH_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER/MODEL/DIMENSION` and we stream vectors into the matching `embedding_<dim>` column automatically
- Supported combinations today: `all-mini-llm` (384), `qwen3-embedding:0.6b` (1024), `qwen3-embedding:4b` (2048), `qwen3-embedding:8b` (4096), plus `jina-embeddings-v4`
- LM Studio's OpenAI-compatible reranker endpoint can now be used for local reranking, so hybrid/local deployments keep the same two-stage retrieval experience as Jina Cloud
- CLI/indexer logs explicitly call out the active dimension + Surreal column so it's obvious which field is being populated

### ✅ **Added - Incremental Indexing with File Change Detection**
- SHA-256-based file change detection tracks added, modified, deleted, and unchanged files between indexing runs
- Differential re-indexing processes only changed files (added + modified), dramatically reducing re-index time for large codebases
- File metadata persistence (`file_metadata` table) stores content hash, size, timestamps, and node/edge counts per file
- Smart cleanup automatically removes orphaned data (nodes, edges, embeddings) for deleted/renamed files
- Backward compatible with existing indexes—falls back to full re-index if metadata unavailable
- `--force` flag now performs clean slate deletion before re-indexing, preventing data accumulation

### 🛠️ **Improved - Surreal Edge Persistence Diagnostics**
- After dependency resolution we now query `edges` directly and log the stored count vs. expected total; any mismatch is surfaced immediately with a warning, making it easier to spot schema or auth issues during indexing

### ⚠️ **Deprecated - MCP Server FAISS+RocksDB Support**

**IMPORTANT**: The MCP server's FAISS+RocksDB graph database solution is now **deprecated** in favor of SurrealDB-based architecture.

**What's Deprecated:**
- MCP server integration with FAISS vector search
- MCP server integration with RocksDB graph storage
- Cloud dual-mode search via MCP protocol

**What Remains Supported:**
- ✅ **CLI commands**: All FAISS/RocksDB operations remain available via `codegraph` CLI
- ✅ **Rust SDK**: Full programmatic access to FAISS/RocksDB functionality
- ✅ **NAPI bindings**: TypeScript/Node.js integration still functional
- ✅ **Local embeddings**: ONNX, Ollama, LM Studio providers unchanged

**Migration Path:**

### ⚡ **Added - Complete Performance Optimization Suite**

#### **1. FAISS Index Caching (10-50x speedup)**
- **Thread-safe in-memory cache** using DashMap for concurrent index access
- **Eliminates disk I/O overhead**: Indexes loaded once, cached for lifetime of process
- **Impact**: First search 300-600ms → Subsequent searches 1-5ms (cached)
- **Memory cost**: 300-600MB for typical codebase with 5-10 shards

#### **2. Embedding Generator Caching (10-100x speedup)**
- **Lazy async initialization** using tokio::sync::OnceCell
- **One-time setup, lifetime reuse**: Generator initialized once across all searches
- **Impact**:
  - ONNX: 500-2000ms → 0.1ms per search (5,000-20,000x faster!)
  - LM Studio: 50-200ms → 0.1ms per search (500-2000x faster!)
  - Ollama: 20-100ms → 0.1ms per search (200-1000x faster!)
- **Memory cost**: 90MB (ONNX) or <1MB (LM Studio/Ollama)

#### **3. Query Result Caching (100x speedup on cache hits)**
- **LRU cache with SHA-256 query hashing** and 5-minute TTL
- **1000 query capacity** (configurable)
- **Impact**: Repeated queries <1ms vs 30-140ms (100-140x faster!)
- **Perfect for**: Agent workflows, API servers, interactive debugging
- **Memory cost**: ~10MB for 1000 cached queries

#### **4. Parallel Shard Searching (2-3x speedup)**
- **Rayon parallel iterators** for concurrent shard search
- **CPU core scaling**: Linear speedup with available cores
- **Impact**:
  - 2 cores: 1.8x speedup
  - 4 cores: 2.5x speedup
  - 8 cores: 3x speedup
- **Implementation**: All shards searched simultaneously, results merged

#### **5. Performance Timing Breakdown**
- **Comprehensive metrics** for all search phases
- **JSON timing data** in every search response
- **Tracked metrics**:
  - Embedding generation time
  - Index loading time
  - Search execution time
  - Node loading time
  - Formatting time
  - Total time
- **Benefits**: Identify bottlenecks, measure optimizations, debug regressions

#### **6. IVF Index Support (10x speedup for large codebases)**
- **Automatic IVF index** for shards >10K vectors
- **O(sqrt(n)) complexity** vs O(n) for Flat index
- **Auto-selection logic**:
  - <10K vectors: Flat index (faster, exact)
  - >10K vectors: IVF index (much faster, ~98% recall)
  - nlist = sqrt(num_vectors), clamped [100, 4096]
- **Performance scaling**:
  - 10K vectors: 50ms → 15ms (3.3x faster)
  - 100K vectors: 500ms → 50ms (10x faster)
  - 1M vectors: 5000ms → 150ms (33x faster!)

### 📊 **Performance Impact**

#### **Before All Optimizations**
| Codebase Size | Search Time |
|---------------|------------|
| Small (1K)    | 300ms      |
| Medium (10K)  | 450ms      |
| Large (100K)  | 850ms      |

#### **After All Optimizations**

**Cold Start (First Search):**
| Codebase Size | Search Time | Speedup |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| Small (1K)    | 190ms      | 1.6x    |
| Medium (10K)  | 300ms      | 1.5x    |
| Large (100K)  | 620ms      | 1.4x    |

**Warm Cache (Subsequent Searches):**
| Codebase Size | Search Time | Speedup |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| Small (1K)    | 25ms       | **12x**     |
| Medium (10K)  | 35ms       | **13x**     |
| Large (100K)  | 80ms       | **10.6x**   |

**Cache Hit (Repeated Queries):**
| Codebase Size | Search Time | Speedup |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| All sizes     | <1ms       | **300-850x!** |

### 🎯 **Real-World Performance Examples**

#### **Agent Workflow:**
```
Query 1: "find auth code"    → 450ms (cold start)
Query 2: "find auth code"    → 0.5ms (cache hit, 900x faster!)
Query 3: "find auth handler" → 35ms (warm cache, 13x faster)
```

#### **API Server (High QPS):**
- Common queries: **0.5ms** response time
- Unique queries: **30-110ms** response time
- Throughput: **100-1000+ QPS** (was 2-3 QPS before)

#### **Large Enterprise Codebase (1M vectors):**
- Before: 5000ms per search
- After (IVF + all optimizations): **150ms** per search
- **Speedup: 33x faster!**

### 💾 **Memory Usage**

**Additional Memory Cost:**
- FAISS index cache: 300-600MB (typical codebase)
- Embedding generator: 90MB (ONNX) or <1MB (LM Studio/Ollama)
- Query result cache: 10MB (1000 queries)
- **Total**: 410-710MB

**Trade-off**: 500-700MB for 10-100x speedup = Excellent

### 🛠️ **Cache Management API**

#### **Index Cache:**
```rust
// Get statistics
let (num_indexes, memory_mb) = get_cache_stats();

// Clear cache (e.g., after reindexing)
clear_index_cache();
```

#### **Query Cache:**
```rust
// Get statistics
let (cached_queries, capacity) = get_query_cache_stats();

// Clear cache
clear_query_cache();
```

### 📝 **Technical Implementation**
